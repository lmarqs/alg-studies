# Make the Largest Number

Given a string, rearrange the string so that no character next to each other are the same. If no such arrangement is possible, then return None.

Example:

```
Input: abbccc
Output: cbcbca
```

```python
def rearrangeString(s):
  # Fill this in.

print rearrangeString('abbccc')
# cbcabc
```
